<p>Nordstrom Inc. is an American chain of luxury department stores, also operating in Canada and
  headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1901 by Swedish American John W. Nordstrom and Carl
  F. Wallin, the company began as a shoe retailer and expanded its inventory to include clothing, accessories,
  handbags, jewelry, cosmetics, and fragrances. Select Nordstrom stores also include wedding and home
  furnishings departments. The company also has in-house cafes, restaurants and espresso bars.</p>
 
  <h2>History</h2>

  <p>In 1887, John W. Nordstrom immigrated to the United States at the age of 16. After landing in New York,
    he first began working in Michigan and was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2)
    potato farm in Arlington, Washington.</p>
    <p>
    By 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Their expansion
    was based on customer service, deep product offerings and full size ranges. Apparel came with its
    purchase of Best Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and the company&#39;s name was changed to Nordstrom&#39;s Best.</p>

   
    <h2>Stores</h2>

    <P>Nordstrom has 380 stores operating in 40 US states, Puerto Rico and Canada, a number which includes 122
      full-line stores and 239  <a href="nordstromrack.html" target="_blank" >Nordstrom Rack</a> stores, seven <a href="https://www.trunkclub.com/" target="_blank">  Trunk Club </a>clubhouses, two Jeffrey boutiques and
      two clearance stores. Nordstrom also serves customers through nordstrom.com, nordstromrack.com, and
      its online private sale site, <a href="https://www.hautelook.com/" target="_blank">HauteLook. </a>
